### Connecting to Instruments

Thorp sends MIDI data, so you'll need to connect it to a MIDI-compatible instrument or plugin. Here's a basic setup:

1.  **MIDI Out:** Set the MIDI output of the Thorp script to your desired instrument.
2.  **Channels:** Ensure the MIDI channel of Thorp matches the MIDI channel of your instrument.
3.  **Clock:** Sync Thorp to your host's clock for tight timing.

### Advanced Patching

*   **Modulation:** Use Thorp's CC outputs to modulate parameters on your synth.
*   **Polyrhythms:** Create complex rhythms by setting different pattern lengths.
*   **Layering:** Run multiple instances of Thorp to layer different sounds and patterns.

## üí° Patch Performance Ideas

### Generative Melodies

*   **Scale Quantizing:** Use the scale view to lock your patterns to a specific key.
*   **Randomization:** Introduce subtle variations by using randomization features.
*   **Evolving Sequences:** Gradually build complexity by adding and removing notes over time.

### Live Performance

*   **Song Mode:** Arrange your patterns in song mode for a structured performance.
*   **Muting:** Use the mute function to bring elements in and out of the mix.
*   **On-the-Fly Editing:** Edit patterns in real-time to create dynamic changes.
